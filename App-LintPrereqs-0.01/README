NAME
    App::LintPrereqs - Check extraneous/missing prerequisites in dist.ini

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
     # Use via lint-prereqs CLI script

DESCRIPTION
    This module has Rinci metadata.

FUNCTIONS
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  lint_prereqs(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Check extraneous/missing prerequisites in dist.ini.

    Check [Prereqs / *] sections in your dist.ini against what's actually
    being used in your Perl code (using Perl::PrereqScanner) and what's in
    Perl core list of modules. Will complain if your prereqs is not actually
    used, or already in Perl core. Will also complain if there are missing
    prereqs.

    Designed to work with prereqs that are manually written. Does not work
    if you use AutoPrereqs.

    Configuration:

    *   [Extras / lint-prereqs / assume-used]

    These are prerequisites that you know are used but can't be detected by
    scan_prereqs. Or prerequisites that you want to include anyway.

    *   [Extras / lint-prereqs / assume-provided]

    These can be used to list prerequisites that are detected by
    scan_prereqs, but you know are already provided by some other modules.
    So to make lint-prereqs pass, include them here.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   default_perl_version => *str* (default: "5.010000")

        Perl version to use when unspecified.

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array). First element (status) is an
    integer containing HTTP status code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx
    function error). Second element (msg) is a string containing error
    message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third element (result) is optional,
    the actual result. Fourth element (meta) is called result metadata and
    is optional, a hash that contains extra information.
